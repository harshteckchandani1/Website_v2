			<h1>Teaching Philosipy</h1>
<p>            
<b>Teaching </b> is not a word for me, it’s my passion. Since my graduation, postgraduation, PhD and now in job I met with multiple professors as student, as colleague and one common thing I found in all my best teacher (Guru) is there passion for teaching. It’s my personal realization that I love teaching so much, even if I am unwell and I am in class, interacting with students, I feel better, and this improve my health as well. 
I paid close attention to my professors, comparing their various ideas and approaches, considering their teaching methods, and determining which ones aided my own learning. I gradually and intentionally built a collection of excellent teaching approaches by continuing this study throughout school, undergrade, and graduate institute. The culmination of those years of observation and analysis, along with the lessons I am currently learning from my own teaching experience, produces the overarching concept that I endeavour for in the classroom: <b> clarity – in presenting content, describing expectations, and communicating educational goals.</b>
